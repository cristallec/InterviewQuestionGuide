# Problem
Given a non-empty array of integer representing a non-negative integer, add/plus one to the integer representation and return the new integer. 

# Example
1. Input: [4, 2, 5]    Output: [4, 2, 6]
The array integer representation 425 becomes 426 when you add one. 
2. Input: [3, 6, 3, 9]    Output: [3, 6, 4, 0]
The array integer representation 3639 becomes 3640 when you add one.
